# Givelytics: Open-Source AI-Driven Donor Prospecting Tool

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for building a free, open-source AI-driven donor prospecting tool that helps non-profits identify potential donors, predict their giving potential, and segment them for targeted outreach.

### 1.2 Scope
The tool will:
- Aggregate publicly available data to analyze donor behavior.
- Use machine learning models to predict donor propensity and capacity.
- Provide real-time analytics and visualizations.
- Integrate with CRM systems (e.g., Salesforce, CiviCRM).
- Be accessible via a web-based interface and an API.
- Include a **Google Ad Grants Keyword Suggestion Tool** to assist non-profits in optimizing online fundraising campaigns.

### 1.3 Target Users
- Non-profits & charities
- Educational institutions
- Political campaigns
- Crowdfunding organizations

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Data Ingestion & Integration
âœ… Ability to collect data from:
- Public donation databases (e.g., IRS 990 filings, political donation records)
- Social media (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter/X insights)
- Census & demographic data
- Open banking & financial APIs (where legal)

âœ… Support for manual CSV uploads of donor lists.
âœ… Integration with existing CRMs (e.g., Salesforce, CiviCRM, Bloomerang).
âœ… API to allow third-party tools to push/pull data.

### 2.2 AI & Machine Learning Models
âœ… **Donor Propensity Model** (predicts likelihood to donate)
- Factors: historical donations, demographics, wealth indicators, social behaviors
- Techniques: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Deep Learning (optional)

âœ… **Wealth Estimation Model** (estimates donation capacity)
- Uses real estate, business ownership, tax records, employment data.
- Techniques: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

âœ… **Lookalike Modeling** (identifies prospects similar to existing donors)
- Finds people with matching behavior & wealth profiles.
- Techniques: KNN, Neural Networks

âœ… **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- Extracts donor sentiment & intent from social media posts and emails.
- Techniques: BERT, OpenAI models (if API-based)

### 2.3 Donor Segmentation & Scoring
âœ… Assigns **donor scores** based on:
- Wealth (net worth, annual income)
- Engagement (email responses, event attendance)
- Philanthropy history (frequency, size of donations)

âœ… Segments donors into:
- High-value prospects
- Recurring donors
- Lapsed donors
- First-time donors

âœ… Generates customized fundraising strategies based on donor category.

### 2.4 Web Interface & Visualization
âœ… **Dashboard for real-time insights**
- Interactive donor segmentation charts
- Predictive scores visualization

âœ… **Search & filtering functionality**
- Locate donors based on wealth, location, or donation history.

âœ… **Reports & Exports**
- Generate PDF/CSV reports for campaigns.

âœ… **Interactive map of donor locations** (optional)

### 2.5 Google Ad Grants Keyword Suggestion Tool
âœ… **Keyword Research**
- Uses AI to generate **fundraising-related keywords** based on donor interests and trends.
- Provides keyword **search volume, CPC estimates, and competitiveness**.

âœ… **Integration with Google Ads API**
- Suggests optimal **ad campaign structures** based on predicted donor behaviors.
- Recommends **ad copy optimization** to maximize conversions.

âœ… **Predictive Ad Performance Modeling**
- Uses machine learning to **forecast which keywords will generate the most donations**.
- Provides a **heatmap of donor interest by keyword**.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance & Scalability
âœ… Scales to support **millions of donor records**.
âœ… Optimized for **low-latency predictions** using caching (e.g., Redis).

### 3.2 Open-Source Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js / Vue.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI / Django / Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **ML Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark (for big data)

### 3.3 API Design
âœ… **RESTful API** with OAuth authentication.
âœ… **OpenAPI documentation** for easy developer integration.

## 4. Future Enhancements
ðŸ“Œ **AI Chatbot for donor engagement**.
ðŸ“Œ **Blockchain-based donor transparency tracking**.
ðŸ“Œ **Predictive event fundraising recommendations**.
ðŸ“Œ **Automated grant writing assistance using AI**.
